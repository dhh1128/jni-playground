# jni-playground

Based on tutorial at http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/java/tutorials/j-jni/j-jni.html.
That tutorial had a couple of bugs and missing pieces which I've figured out.

The .sh files show what commands I ran on ubuntu14 with oracle java 8 installed, to make everything work.

I moved the first sample into the Foo package just to make sure I understood how namespaces would affect things.
